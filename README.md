                                    # "username" calls user input

                                    # with connecting to the group chat
                                    # parameter "group" calls the user input for group chat

                                    # It prints "joined group" and then the group.

                                    # the same parameters as "join_group", see above
                                    # "get_channel" returns "zhelper.zthread_fork" which I 
                                    # assume is a function because it has parameters but
                                    # I don't see it being defined in the lab_chat file.
                                    # Hovering over it, PyCharm shows it's from the Pyre module
